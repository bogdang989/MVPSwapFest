# 🐴 $MVP Token — Pet Jokić’s Horses

---

## 🎯 Short Summary

**$MVP** is a community-driven Flow token that blends collectibles, gaming, and fandom.  
Built around the legend of **Nikola Jokić**, his Top Shot moments, and his love of horses, the project rewards fans for trading, competing, and playing across the Flow ecosystem.  

The flagship event — **Swapfest** — lets users trade Jokić Top Shot Moments, climb a real-time leaderboard, and earn prizes.

## 💡 The Concept

“**Pet Jokić’s Horses**” started as a meme-token idea.  
The mission: **turn fandom into gameplay.**

Players earn and spend **$MVP** by:

- 🏇 **Trading** in and out Jokić moments and $MVP token  
- 💰 **Staking** $MVP to earn rewards on [Increment.fi Farms](https://increment.fi/farms)  
- 🎮 **Playing** various mini games in Discord or on the $MVP website

## 🧩 Swapfest — The Core Contest

**Swapfest** is a seasonal competition where collectors send Jokić moments to the treasury and earn points based on rarity.

### 🔹 How It Works

- 💸 **Send Moments:** Users “swap in” Jokić NBA Top Shot moments into the Swapfest vault.  
- 📈 **Earn Points:** Each moment’s type, tier, and serial determine its value.  
- 🏆 **Climb the Leaderboard:** Points update in real time using the Find Labs API, which pulls blockchain transaction data and updates player rankings live.  
- 🎁 **Win Rewards:** Top collectors receive Flow-based prizes, rare NFTs, and $MVP bonuses.

## 🧱 What We Built During the Hackathon

During the hackathon, we:

- ⚙️ **Integrated Find Labs API** for real-time point updates and instant leaderboard recalculation.  
- 📊 **Built a live leaderboard dashboard** showing standings, stats, and prizes.  
- 🤖 **Linked the Discord bot** with on-chain activity, so users could track swaps and rankings directly in chat.  

This made **Swapfest** the first fully automated, on-chain Jokić-themed contest — merging collectibles, smart contracts, and community competition.
